# Problem 1
# Equivalent Resistance Calculation Using Graph Theory

This document outlines the calculation of equivalent resistance using graph theory, providing both a pseudocode and a Python implementation.

## Option 1: Simplified Task â€“ Algorithm Description

### Algorithm Description

1.  **Graph Representation:**
    * Represent the electrical circuit as a graph $G = (V, E)$, where:
        * $V$ is the set of nodes (junctions).
        * $E$ is the set of edges (resistors).
        * Each edge $e \in E$ has a weight $R_e$ representing the resistance.
2.  **Series Reduction:**
    * Identify linear chains of nodes with degree 2.
    * Combine the resistances of the series edges into a single equivalent resistance: $R_{eq} = R_1 + R_2 + ... + R_n$.
    * Replace the series chain with a single edge having the equivalent resistance.
3.  **Parallel Reduction:**
    * Identify parallel edges between two nodes.
    * Combine the resistances of the parallel edges into a single equivalent resistance: $R_{eq} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + ... + \frac{1}{R_n}}$.
    * Replace the parallel edges with a single edge having the equivalent resistance.
4.  **Iteration:**
    * Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the graph is reduced to a single edge connecting the two terminals of the circuit.
    * This final edge's weight is the equivalent resistance of the circuit.
5.  **Nested Combinations:**
    * The iterative nature of the algorithm handles nested combinations naturally. Inner series and parallel combinations are reduced first, then outer combinations are handled as the graph simplifies.
    * The order of series and parallel reduction can affect the efficiency, but not the final result.

### Pseudocode

```python
function calculate_equivalent_resistance(graph):
  while graph has more than 2 nodes:
    # Series Reduction
    for each node with degree 2:
      r1 = resistance of edge connecting to node
      r2 = resistance of other edge connecting to node
      req = r1 + r2
      remove node and its edges
      add edge between the two neighboring nodes with resistance req
```
    # Parallel Reduction
    for each pair of nodes with multiple edges:
      resistances = list of resistances of parallel edges
      req = 1 / sum(1 / r for r in resistances)
      remove parallel edges
      add single edge between the nodes with resistance req

  return resistance of the remaining edge
  ```
